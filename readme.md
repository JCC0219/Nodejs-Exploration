# Browser Cookie Storage and Session Management with Express.js

## Installation

To enable session management in your Express.js application, use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install express-session
```

## Example Usage

Integrate session management into your app by adding the following code:

```javascript
app.use(
  session({ secret: "my secret", resave: false, saveUninitialized: false })
);
```

## Session Handling

Session data is stored securely as a cookie in the browser. The cookie content is hashed, and a corresponding session entry is maintained in the server's database. However, please note that if the server restarts, session cookies will no longer function as they're stored server-side.
